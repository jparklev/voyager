üëã Welcome to Voyager, the official user interface for the [Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network/).

üíª Voyager is a desktop application built with [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). Voyager runs on macOS 10.9+, Windows 7+, and Debian-based Linux distros.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is still alpha-level software. __DO NOT__ enter your Cosmos fundraiser seed into Voyager.

üéâ Binary releases are [available here](https://github.com/cosmos/voyager/releases).

### Prerequisites
#### Install dependencies
##### On Mac
```bash
# install go, set $GOPATH
brew install go

# install glide for go dependencies
brew install glide

# install yarn for js dependencies
brew install yarn
```

##### On Windows

Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

Install [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/releases)

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows)

#### Install Gaia

`gaia` is a prepackaged version of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint. You will need `gaia` installed.

```bash
# install gaia
go get github.com/cosmos/gaia
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cosmos/gaia
git checkout v0.5.0
glide install
make install
```

#### Prepare Voyager

```bash
# checkout voyager
cd ~ # or wherever you like to keep your project files
git checkout https://github.com/cosmos/voyager.git
cd voyager

# install js dependencies
yarn
```

---

### Develop

To run Voyager on the default testnet (`gaia-2`):
```bash
$ yarn testnet
```

To run Voyager on a specific testnet from the [testnets](https://github.com/tendermint/testnets) repo:
```bash
$ yarn testnet <networkName>
```

To run Voyager on a local node:
<!-- This way would be desired but local nodes apparently do not work (do not produce blocks)```bash
# First start a local node using the the configuration provided in Voyager.
$ gaia node start --home=./app/networks/local
# Then start Voyager connecting to your local node.
$ yarn testnet local
``` -->
First start a local node following the Gaia [readme](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia).

Then start Voyager pointing at your local node.
```bash
$ COSMOS_NODE=localhost yarn testnet
```

### Production

Building requires that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) is installed
on your system.

Execute the following command to see building options.

```shell
yarn run build --help
```

Run the app.
```bash
open builds/Cosmos-{platform}-x64/Cosmos.app
```

When you are testing the build system you can skip the repackaging of the JS files.
```bash
$ yarn run build --platform=darwin --skip-pack
```

To test if your build worked run:
```bash
$ yarn test:exe {path to the build executable}
```

---

### Testing

Voyager is using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) to run unit tests.

```bash
$ yarn test
```

To check test coverage locally run following. It will spin up a webserver and provide you with a link to the coverage report web page.

```bash
$ yarn test:coverage
```

---

### Debug

To debug the electron application, build it and run the node inspector for the built files:

```bash
$ electron --inspect-brk builds/{{your build}}/resources/app/dist/main.js
```

Then attach to the debugger via the posted url in Chrome.

To debug the electron view, set the environment variable `COSMOS_DEVTOOLS` to something truthy like `"true"`. The Chrome DevTools will appear when you start Voyager.

To see the console output of the view in your terminal, set the environment variable `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING` to something truthy like `1`.

### Flags

A list of all environment variables and their purpose:

|Variable|Values|default|Purpose|
|--|--|--|--|
|NODE_ENV|'production', 'development'|||
|LOGGING|'true', 'false'|'true'|Disable logging|
|COSMOS_NETWORK|{path to network configuration folder}|'../networks/gaia-1'|Network to connect to|
|COSMOS_HOME|{path to config persistence folder}|'$HOME/voyager[-dev]'||
|COSMOS_NODE|{ip of a certain node}||Node to connect to|
|COSMOS_DEVTOOLS|'true', 'false'|'false'|Open the debug panel in the electron view|
|ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING|'true', 'false'|'false'|Redirect the browser view console output to the console|
|PREVIEW|'true', 'false'|'true' if NODE_ENV 'development'|Show/Hide features that are in development|


### FAQ

- If tendermint crashes and the log shows `Tendermint state.AppHash does not match AppHash after replay.` delete the config folders at `$HOME/.cosmos-voyager[-dev]`.

- If you use yarn, the post-install hook may not execute. If this happens you'll have to execute the script manually:
```bash
$ cd app
$ yarn
$ cd ..
$ npm run rebuild
```

- If electron shows the error: `A DLL initialization routine has failed.` rebuild the electron dependencies:
```bash
$ npm run rebuild
```

- If you have trouble installing dependencies, remove all the lockfiles and try installing again.
```bash
$ rm -rf app/yarn.lock
$ rm -rf app/package-lock.json
$ rm -rf yarn.lock
$ rm -rf package-lock.json
```

- If your components are not found using a short path, check if the path resolution is applied for Webpack (`webpack.renderer.js > rendererConfig.resolve.alias`) and Jest (`package.json > jest.moduleNameMapper`).

- If starting the development server fails with the error: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:9080`, you have still a development server process running. Kill it with `kill $(lsof -t -i:9080)` on Unix systems. On Windows Powershell first look for the processes with `netstat -a -o -n |  Select-String -Pattern "9080"` then kill them with `taskkill /F /PID {PID}`.
