We identified several core customers for Voyager:

1.  Investors

* They know what a wallet is
* They know how to send/receive coins
* They are maybe not familiar with staking
* They are maybe not familiar with governance and voting on the blockchain
* They are probably security conscious
* They want to use Voyager as a tool to create a profit
* They want to see if they created a profit
* They want to see if the experienced a loss
* They probably use Windows

2.  Crypto Beginners

* They want a wallet to see the amount of tokens they own
* They want to send/receive tokens
* They donâ€™t want to participate
* They are not interested in the blockchain meta data

3.  Crypto Enthusiasts

* They want to understand how Cosmos works
* They will probably not use Voyager everyday

4.  Wallet Builders

* They want to build their own wallet

We will focus on 1) and 2) as we assume these are the biggest groups of users at release.
