  .fundraiser-warning__title Warning &ndash; Do not enter your fundraiser seed. This software has not been audited. Never enter your 12-word seed while your computer is connected to the internet.
  .fundraiser-warning__subtitle Even when we do start supporting fundraiser seeds, don't use it except for testing or with small amounts. Soon we will release a command line interface to use for the signing of transactions offline including support for certain hardware ledgers.
